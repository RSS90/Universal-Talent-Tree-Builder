This builder is data-driven. Use the editor or simply adjust the objects in the TALENT_DATA script (data.js) (classes, trees, talents, rows/columns, prerequisites, descriptions). Right-clicking on talents deducts points. Each talent requires 5 points in the lower tiers.

Everything runs locally on your PC! When saving the trees, the new data.js will be “downloaded.”

It is “downloaded” because JavaScript is not allowed to write data directly to your hard drive.

Once you have found the saved file in your downloads folder, simply overwrite the file in your Tree Builder folder and refresh the site.

And remember: no backup, no mercy :D
